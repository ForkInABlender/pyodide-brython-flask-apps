# pyodide-brython-flask-apps
Flask, serving pyodide controlled runtime instantiated by brython.js

under ``fs_bundle`` is the basic webpack that will be loaded for use. Mainly it will contain just enough to load pyodide from localhost to serve on flask.
 The rest is what you api wise put into a place pathwise it understands or draws from :)
